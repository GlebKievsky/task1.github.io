                    <p class="body-text">A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight'. 
                    Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of 
                    experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 
                    2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and 
                    sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. 
                    Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 
                    30 minutes daily for five days a week.
